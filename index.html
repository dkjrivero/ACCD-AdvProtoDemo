        Welcome to Adv. Prototyping repository!
    </h1>

    <h2 style="color:blue;margin-top: 100px;">
      What do Prototypes Prototype?
    </h2>
    <h3 style="margin-right: 800px">
      "Users experience the combined effect of such interrelated features; and the 
      task of designing—and prototyping—the user experience is therefore complex." 
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 800px">
      The task of creating a project will always require us to test it through multiple 
      user groups multiple times. Once any one has finished any type of design, the next 
      is to test it out to see what could be improved or fixed to make it better. The whole 
      point is for users to experience a product in the best way possible, without them 
      getting frustrated. When users get frustrated it causes them to want to quit or 
      abandon the product, which would decline the products company significantly. All this 
      allows us to test out many features and combinations that are used to create the best 
      experience for the products we design. 
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin-right: 800px">
      "Making separate prototypes enabled specific design questions to be addressed with 
      as much clarity as possible."
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 800px">
      When we as designers create different prototypes it allows for us to test out multiple 
      scenarios. By creating different scenarios, it creates solutions and problems that can 
      become part to the integrated design. Solutions can help to determine how much detail 
      the product can handle while the problems show us exactly what can’t be done. Attacking 
      the design from multiple points of views allows you to implement solutions from one 
      prototype into a separate prototype. This enables a more complete test of features and 
      user interface to take place.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin-right: 800px">
      "Some prototypes are built primarily to answer technical questions about how a future 
      artifact might actually be made to work."
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 800px">
      Most teams create implementation prototypes as a means to testing and experimenting with 
      the feasibility of the artifact. This allows the design team to also gain feedback from 
      users on any performance issues, as well as the interaction users have with it. These 
      prototypes  are mostly used to discover methods that have adequate specifications for the 
      final artifact to achieve. With more specifications it allows the design team  to not have 
      to worry about defining its look or feel and the role it plays for users.

      Bee Natural System
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Why did you decide to work on this topic, what's your interest there?
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 800px">
      The bee diversity has declined massively over the last couple of years, 
      causing them to be endangered. Our planet simply can not survive without 
      bees and it is up to us to save them. By creating this bee natural system 
      I hope to bring more awareness to the extinction of bees.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How did you envision your system in the beginning and how did that vision change?
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 800px">
      In the beginning I had envision incorporating a bee collecting honey from a flower 
      and then taking the honey back to the beehive. Although since then I have incorporated 
      multiple flowers that multiple bees come out of the beehive to collect and bring back 
      to the beehive making it bigger, each time more honey is collected.
    </p>
    <h3>
      At least one image of your diagram.
    </h3>
    <img style="width: 50%;"src="./bee-natural-system.jpg" alt="Bee Natural System.jpg">
    <h3>
      How did you translate your diagram into code?
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 800px">
      The diagram was very helpful in helping me to understand which 
      functions each object would have and how they would all be 
      intertwined which each other.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How did you deal with the complexity in your system?
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 800px">
      Through help from online resources, it allowed me to understand 
      different formulas that helped me to do what I needed to complete 
      the bee natural system.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How did you decide on the interactive elements?
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 800px">
      To make the bee natural system more complex I wanted to be able to add 
      more flowers for the bees to catch rather than a set amount. By pressing 
      the space bar you can add as many flowers as the user wants. I also wanted 
      to make it more interesting by creating multiple bees going after the flowers 
      and by pressing the mouse it creates multiple bees that will go and attack 
      the flowers.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What would be some paths for future development of the project?
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 800px">
      For the future, I wanted to create different types of flowers that would 
      also give each bee a different honey count. Possibly making it an interactive 
      game that scores how much honey bees can collect within a certain time limit.
    </p>

      Code Examples:
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-right: 800px">
      // adds honey when bee brings flower back<br>
      void addHoney() {<br>
      this.honeyCount++;<br>
      this.size += 0.5;}
    </p>
    <p style="margin-right: 800px">
      // caculates distance from bee to flower<br>
      double distanceToFlower(Sunflower flower) {<br>
      return Math.sqrt((this.position.x - flower.position.x) * (this.position.x - 
      flower.position.x) + (this.position.y - flower.position.y) * (this.position.y - 
      flower.position.y));}
    </p>
    <p style="margin-right: 800px">
      // if bee is not busy check distance to flower, go to closest flower and set as new target<br>
      if (flowers.size() != 0 && !busy) {<br>
      print("seeking\n");<br>
      if (target == null) {<br>
      Sunflower closest = flowers.get(0);<br>
      double closestDist = Double.MAX_VALUE;}}
    </p>
    <p> 
      // checks distance to each flower and finds closest <br>
      for (Sunflower flower : flowers) { <br>
      double currDist = this.distanceToFlower(flower);<br>
      if (currDist <= closestDist && !hive.targets.containsKey(flower)) {<br>
      closest = flower;<br>
      closestDist = currDist;}}
    </p>
