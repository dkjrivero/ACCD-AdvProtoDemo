        <ul style="list-style: none;">
          - Why did you decide to work on this topic, what's your interest there?
        </ul>
        <p>
          The bee diversity has declined massively over the last couple of years, 
          causing them to be endangered. Our planet simply can not survive without 
          bees and it is up to us to save them. By creating this bee natural system 
          I hope to bring more awareness to the extinction of bees.
        </p>
        <ul>
          - How did you envision your system in the beginning and how did that vision change?
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the beginning I had envision incorporating a bee collecting honey from a flower 
          and then taking the honey back to the beehive. Although since then I have incorporated 
          multiple flowers that multiple bees come out of the beehive to collect and bring back 
          to the beehive making it bigger, each time more honey is collected.
        </p>
        <ul>
          - At least one image of your diagram.
        </ul>
        <img src="Bee Natural System.jpg" alt="Bee Natural System.jpg">
        <ul>
          - How did you translate your diagram into code?
        </ul>
        <p>
          The diagram was very helpful in helping me to understand which 
          functions each object would have and how they would all be 
          intertwined which each other.
        </p>
        <ul>
          - How did you deal with the complexity in your system?
        </ul>
        <p>
          Through help from online resources, it allowed me to understand 
          different formulas that helped me to do what I needed to complete 
          the bee natural system.
        </p>
        <ul>
          - How did you decide on the interactive elements?
        </ul>
        <p>
          To make the bee natural system more complex I wanted to be able to add 
          more flowers for the bees to catch rather than a set amount. By pressing 
          the space bar you can add as many flowers as the user wants. I also wanted 
          to make it more interesting by creating multiple bees going after the flowers 
          and by pressing the mouse it creates multiple bees that will go and attack 
          the flowers.
        </p>
        <ul>
          - What would be some paths for future development of the project?
        </ul>
        <p>
          For the future, I wanted to create different types of flowers that would 
          also give each bee a different honey count. Possibly making it an interactive 
          game that scores how much honey bees can collect within a certain time limit.
