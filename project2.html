            Summary
        </h3><br>
        <p style="margin-right: 20%;">
            I wanted to expand on my previous project and create a more interactive way to 
            play with a bee’s natural system. Hopefully bringing more awareness to them as 
            they are starting to become extinct and if they do will effect our ecosystem tremendously.
        <br><br>
            In the beginning, I really wanted to have my controller showcase the project by 
            having its physical shape look like a bee. Although I later realized the difficulty of it, 
            I then turned it into a box controller that would contain sensors with visuals to also 
            depict what each one does.
        <br><br>
            The sensors I used for this project were the potentiometer for adding and removing 
            bee’s and a force sensor that depending on how hard you apply pressure will add 
            flowers for the bee’s to collect. To depict this through the controller I used a 
            stress ball and added flower petals to it, now making the user have to squeeze it in 
            order to add flowers. For the adding and removal of bee’s I drew a larger bee to 
            depict adding bees and a tiny bee to depict removing a bee.
        <br><br>
            For the controller, I needed a shape that was long enough in width to hold my breadboard and because 
            of it being so long, I found it difficult to be creative with the shape of the controller. 
            Leading me to make the sensor controllers more interesting to create a fun playfulness 
            to it that will intrigue users to want to play.
        <br><br>
            The future of this project would be to add a more gaming approach to it. As of right now 
            this game seems more as a fun thing to play with for a couple of minutes and for the future 
            it would be more creative to see levels and having to acquire a specific amount of honey 
            in order to get to the next level.
