      Summary
    </h3><br>
    <p style="margin-right: 20%;">
      The bee diversity has declined massively over the last couple of years, 
      causing them to be endangered. Our planet simply can not survive without 
      bees and it is up to us to save them. By creating this bee natural system 
      I hope to bring more awareness to the extinction of bees.
    <br><br>
      In the beginning I had envisioned incorporating a bee collecting honey from a flower 
      and then taking the honey 
      back to the beehive. Although since then I have expanded on the idea and have incorporated 
      multiple flowers that 
      multiple bees will come out of the beehive to collect and bring back 
      to the beehive making it bigger, each time more honey is collected.

    <p style="margin-right: 20%;">
      The diagram above was very helpful in helping me to understand which 
      functions each object would have and how they would all be 
      intertwined which each other.
    <br><br>
      Although through out the way I did come into some problems, but with some help 
      from online resources I was able to debug and create a bee catching flower for honey system. 
      These different formulas that helped me to do what I needed to complete 
      the bee natural system have been posted down below, to show and explain the complexity of it.
    <br><br>
      So, in order for me to make the bee natural system more complex I wanted to be able to add 
      more flowers for the bees to catch rather than a set amount. By pressing 
      the space bar you can add as many flowers as the user wants. I also wanted 
      to make it more interesting by creating multiple bees going after the flowers 
      and by pressing the mouse it creates multiple bees that will go and attack 
      the flowers.
    <br><br>
      For the future, I want to create different types of flowers that would 
      also give each bee a different honey count. Possibly making it an interactive 
      game that scores how much honey bees can collect within a certain time limit.
