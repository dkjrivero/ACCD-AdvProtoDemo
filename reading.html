        What do Prototypes Prototype?
        </h2>
        <h3>
      "Users experience the combined effect of such interrelated features; and the 
        task of designing—and prototyping—the user experience is therefore complex." 
        </h3>
        <p>
        The task of creating a project will always require us to test it through multiple 
        user groups multiple times. Once any one has finished any type of design, the next 
        is to test it out to see what could be improved or fixed to make it better. The whole 
        point is for users to experience a product in the best way possible, without them 
        getting frustrated. When users get frustrated it causes them to want to quit or 
        abandon the product, which would decline the products company significantly. All this 
        allows us to test out many features and combinations that are used to create the best 
        experience for the products we design. 
        </p><br>
        <h3>
        "Making separate prototypes enabled specific design questions to be addressed with 
        as much clarity as possible."
        </h3>
        <p>
        When we as designers create different prototypes it allows for us to test out multiple 
        scenarios. By creating different scenarios, it creates solutions and problems that can 
        become part to the integrated design. Solutions can help to determine how much detail 
        the product can handle while the problems show us exactly what can’t be done. Attacking 
        the design from multiple points of views allows you to implement solutions from one 
        prototype into a separate prototype. This enables a more complete test of features and 
        user interface to take place.
        </p><br>
        <h3>
        "Some prototypes are built primarily to answer technical questions about how a future 
        artifact might actually be made to work."
        </h3>
        <p>
        Most teams create implementation prototypes as a means to testing and experimenting with 
        the feasibility of the artifact. This allows the design team to also gain feedback from 
        users on any performance issues, as well as the interaction users have with it. These 
        prototypes  are mostly used to discover methods that have adequate specifications for the 
        final artifact to achieve. With more specifications it allows the design team  to not have 
        to worry about defining its look or feel and the role it plays for users.
